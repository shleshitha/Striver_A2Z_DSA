Problem statement
Sam is making a Triangular painting for a maths project.

An N-dimensional Triangle is represented by the lower triangle of the pattern filled with integers starting from 1.

For every value of ‘N’, help sam to print the corresponding N-dimensional Triangle.

Example:
Input: ‘N’ = 3

Output: 
1
1 2 
1 2 3
Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Constraints :
1  <= N <= 25
Time Limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1:
3
Sample Output 1:
1
1 2 
1 2 3
Sample Input 2 :
1
Sample Output 2 :
1

CODE:

void nTriangle(int n) {
	for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
		for(int j=1;j<=i;j++)
		cout<<j<<" ";
		cout<<endl;
	}
}
